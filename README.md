#INTELNVMCLILIBRARY

Intel NVM CLI Library is a framework library supporting common
Intel NVM storage command line interface (CLI) applications. 

GNU Make is used to build for Linux and Windows.
As such we recommend mingw_w64 and msys be used to build in a windows
environment. Both of which can be found at mingw.org
