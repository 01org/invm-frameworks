 The symbol is referenced by gettext.m4 (autoconf m4 macro fragment
 that ships with GNU gettext), to check if libintl is GNU origin or not.
 Since we are trying to mimic GNU gettext, we supply the symbol just to
 make gettext.m4 happy.
 .
 If we do not provide this symbol, as a result of gettext.m4, *.mo will be
 installed into /usr/lib/locale, not /usr/share/locale.  It is not desirable.
 .
 Yes, I understand this is a dirty hack.  gettext.m4 is doing something
 very wrong here and I have no other choice.

 This file contains a non-GNU implementation of gettext with more attractive
 license terms.  It came from an old version of FreeBSD.  I've simplified it
 significantly, getting rid of things there to handle obscure cases we won't
 encounter in our code.  Also made changes so it works with MinGW.

 from token to token. Transitions from states are defined in the functions. If there are no valid
 transitions a ParseErrorResult is returned with information about the token found and the
 available transitions.
